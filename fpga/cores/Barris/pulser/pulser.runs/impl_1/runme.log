INFO: [Timing 38-191] Multithreading enabled for timing update using a maximum of 4 CPUs
WARNING: [Timing 38-313] There are no user specified timing constraints. Timing constraints are needed for proper timing analysis.
WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design!
Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock for sequential elements. For pure combinatorial circuits, please specify a virtual clock, otherwise the vectorless estimation might be inaccurate

Running DRC as a precondition to command write_bitstream
INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 4 threads
ERROR: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (NSTD-1) Unspecified I/O Standard - 70 out of 70 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: s00_axis_tdata[31:0], m_axis_tdata[31:0], aclk, aresetn, s00_axis_tready, s00_axis_tvalid, m_axis_tvalid, complete_n.
